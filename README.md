# Learn Test Driven Development Using JAVA
> I am going to explain you a very basic implementation of `Singly Linkedlist` making use of test driven development methodology. The whole idea is to help larger audience (irrespective of their experties and experience) understand `how it works?`. But feel free to choose another implementation and accordingly, write test cases to evolve code.

``` // Test â€“ 1: 
public class LinkListTest {
    @Test
    public void shouldTestEmptyLinkList() {
        LinkList linkList = new LinkList();
        assertEquals(true, linkList.isEmpty());
    }
}
```
